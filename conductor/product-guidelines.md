# Product Guidelines: NASCAR DFS Optimizer

## Visual Identity & Aesthetic
- **Core Style: Neobrutalism.** Adhere to the master design system with 4px solid black borders, hard drop shadows (8px+ offset), and the neon accent palette (Cyan, Yellow, Magenta).
- **Dark Mode Primary.** The application defaults to a pure black background (#000000) to maximize contrast with neon UI elements and reduce eye strain during long optimization sessions.
- **Typography.** Use bold, monospace headings for a mechanical/technical feel and system-standard sans-serif fonts for high-density data tables to ensure legibility.

## Voice & Tone
- **Professional & Precision-Focused.** Communication should be direct, data-driven, and technically accurate. Avoid fluff; use terms like "convergence," "stochastic sampling," and "constraint validation."
- **Institutional Confidence.** The copy should reflect the "Axiomatic" nature of the model—presenting the optimizer as a high-precision instrument for serious competitors.

## User Interaction & Experience
- **Snappy & Mechanical.** Interactions should feel instantaneous and deterministic. State changes (e.g., toggling a constraint or starting a job) must provide immediate, bold visual feedback.
- **Contextual Disclosure.** Organize complexity using tabbed interfaces and collapsible panels. Maintain a focused "Cockpit" view for primary operations, while allowing deep-dives into raw data and ontology graphs.
- **Metaphorical Visualization.** Translate abstract "metaphysical" properties into intuitive visual metaphors. Use iconography and color-coding (e.g., aggression scales, risk indicators) to make complex simulation variables accessible without losing technical depth.

## Structural Principles
- **Axiomatic Enforcement.** The UI must clearly distinguish between "Soft" constraints (user-tunable preferences) and "Hard" Axiomatic rules (physics-compliant invariants that cannot be violated).
- **Real-Time Feedback.** Provide live visual telemetry for background jobs, including convergence logs and MCMC sampling progress, to build trust in the optimization process.
